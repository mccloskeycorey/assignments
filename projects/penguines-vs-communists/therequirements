Create two parties (Create a Javascript constructor function and use the new keyword to instantiate the parties)
Each party has a name ("Penguins" and "Communists" - or whatever you want)

Each party has a starting population of 1,000,000

Flip a coin (random number between 1 and 2) to see which party attacks first

Create a function called sendNuke(party, onHit, onMiss) where:
the first parameter party is the Javascript object of the party that will be attacked
the second parameter onHit is a callback function that will be called if the attack is successful
the third parameter onMiss is a callback function that will be called if the attack is unsuccessful

the onHit and onMiss functions each take one parameter of type party (just forwarding the party you already passed into sendNuke)
Print messages in the callbacks that are appropriate - e.g. if the attack missed then it would log "The Penguins' nuke missed the Communists and instead landed in the ocean" or something along those lines

A random algorithm will be used to determine if the attack is a miss or a hit (this can happen in the sendNuke function

If an attack is successful initiate a random damage amount

After an attack is completed (or missed) the opposing party will initiate an attack.
This process will repeat until one of the parties reaches a 0 population
