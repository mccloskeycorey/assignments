            <p>Today Closkey City was attacked and nearly destroyed by the netorious <span class="chim">Chimichanga</span>. It appeared out of no where. People ran for cover when the Chimichanga rampaged, destroying, homes and bussinesses "like a younger Corey would a ginger bread house".</p>

            <p>Just when everyone was losing hope an unlikley hero arrived to save the day! <span>Deadpool</span> was on scene and it was as if fate had brought these two together to wage a most epic of battles. Deadpool was hard pressed to defeat <span>Chimichanga</span> for he was a fearsome foe. More than once the bystanders though Deadpool was going to lose the battle, but as if buy a miracle he pulled through.</p>
            <p>Here at Fake News Global we were able to get an exclusive interview with our hero. Who said it was one of the hardest battles he has ever faced. Deadpool told us that there were moments when wrestling Chimichanga that he almost didn't keep it down. And he doesn't have to stop on the way home to pick up dinner.</p>
